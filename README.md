Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is a simple web-based Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can play against the computer and keep track of your score.

Demo
You can view a live demo of the game by opening the index.html file in your browser.

Features
Simple and responsive interface.
Tracks the score for both the player and the computer.
Displays the result after each round (win, lose, or draw).
Playable in any modern web browser.
Project Structure
The project is divided into three main files:

index.html - Contains the structure of the game (HTML).
styles.css - Contains the styling and animations for the game (CSS).
scripts.js - Contains the game logic and interactivity (JavaScript).
How to Run
Clone this repository or download the files to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.
Click the "Start Game" button to begin playing.
Choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors and try to beat the computer!
How It Works
The game starts with a "Start Game" button. Clicking it hides the start screen and shows the game screen.
On the game screen, you can choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Once you make a choice, the computer will randomly choose one as well.
After both choices are made, the game will compare them to determine the result:
Rock beats Scissors.
Scissors beats Paper.
Paper beats Rock.
The result is displayed, and the score is updated accordingly.
The game continues until the page is refreshed or closed.
Technologies Used
