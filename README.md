# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple web-based Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can play against the computer and keep track of your score.

## Demo

You can view a live demo of the game by opening the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Features

- Simple and responsive interface.
- Tracks the score for both the player and the computer.
- Displays the result after each round (win, lose, or draw).
- Playable in any modern web browser.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main files:

1. **`index.html`** - Contains the structure of the game (HTML).
2. **`styles.css`** - Contains the styling and animations for the game (CSS).
3. **`scripts.js`** - Contains the game logic and interactivity (JavaScript).

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Click the "Start Game" button to begin playing.
4. Choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors and try to beat the computer!

## How It Works

1. The game starts with a "Start Game" button. Clicking it hides the start screen and shows the game screen.
2. On the game screen, you can choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Once you make a choice, the computer will randomly choose one as well.
3. After both choices are made, the game will compare them to determine the result:
   - **Rock** beats **Scissors**.
   - **Scissors** beats **Paper**.
   - **Paper** beats **Rock**.
4. The result is displayed, and the score is updated accordingly.
5. The game continues until the page is refreshed or closed.
